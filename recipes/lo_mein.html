            <li>1/4 tsp of salt</li>
            <li>1/8 tsp of baking soda</li>
            <li>2 tbsp of cooking wine</li>
            <li>2 tbsp of cornstarch</li>
            <li>Black pepper</li>
            <li>1 medium-sized onion sliced thinly</li>
            <li>3 pieces of scallion cut into 2 inches long pieces</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice beef into 1/8 of inches thick pieces.</li>
            <li>
                Marinade it with salt, baking soda, soy sauce, Chinese cooking wine, cornstarch, and some freshly grounded black pepper.
                Mix well and let it sit for 20 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Bring a pot of water to a boil. Cook fresh egg noodles for 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>
                For the wok, turn the heat up to max and heat the wok until it is smoking hot. Add a generous amount of oil. Give it a toss and so the oil
                will create a slight non-stick surface on the bottom. Wait for the oil to be smoking again. Add the marinade beef, then stir and cook.
            </li>
            <li>
                When the beef is halfway cooked, you should still be able to see some pink color here and there. Add a bunch of sliced onion. Stir for
                another 15 seconds.
            </li>
            <li>
                By now, the noodles should be ready. Take them out and shake off the excess water. Throw a bunch of scallions into the wok along with the
                cooked noodles. Turn off the heat.
            </li>
            <li>Add soy sauce, oyster sauce, and dark soy sauce. Mix until the seasoning is well combined and you are done.</li>
        </ol>
